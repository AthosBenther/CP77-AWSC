Ok, chooms. Time to organize a road-map. The mod is rapidly expanding it's scope, what makes me rapidly lose track or focus lol.

## THIS LIST WILL CHANGE AND BE EXPANDED.
I don't remember all functions in one go. And user suggestions may impact the road map.

So, lets list features, and try to tie it to versions:


### Not version tied yet:
- Mitigate damage scaling based on magazine size and fire rate
  - For that it'll be necessary to remove Items.Base_Weapon_inline103 from each gun's statsModifiers,
      and replace it with a weapon-specific modifier coupled with code to change it's value based on the cycleTime or APS and DPS
- Change ADS time
- Change Base Zoom

### 1.0 release:
Covers all the missing features on SWSC

- Melee
  - Damage
  - Attack Speed
- Implants (will probably be part of Melee)
  - Damage
  - Range
  - Speed

 
### 0.9 Multipliers Update
Will introduce stats multipliers that will change the value for lots of stats at the same time. useful for things like Recoil and Spread that are split between multiple stats that are not relevant individually

- Ranged
  - Recoil
  - Spread
  - Sway
  - Reload Time


### 0.8 Menu Update 2
Will update the already crowded menu to work with paginations

- Adds a button on the variant selector that takes you to the Weapon page.
- Weapon page will be divided into zones for better stat manipulation


### 0.7.x
- Adds Fire Mode selection


### 0.7 Iconics Update (Alpha Testing)
- ✓ Adds Default Variant
  - ✓ Adds Crosshair selection
- ✓ Adds Iconics, given unique stats
